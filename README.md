# Introduction

This react starter project was made possible from [jsramblings](https://jsramblings.com/creating-a-react-app-with-webpack/) tutorial.

This repo is intended to be used by [the-scaffolder](https://github.com/kneyugn/the-scaffolder) repository. The "templating" workflow will pull from it and execute "scripts/process-files.js". The output of parsed and final form of templating will be placed in the "output" folder. The final artifacts are then used to upload in the current repository that is executing the templating workflow.
